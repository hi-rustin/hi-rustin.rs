Recently we released [Rustup 1.26.0], which includes a bunch of new features and bug fixes. We also upgraded the [clap] version to 3.2.25, which is a major version upgrade. This upgrade was a bit tricky, because clap 3.0.0 had a lot of breaking changes. We needed to make sure that the new version of Rustup worked as expected. So before we upgraded clap we added [UI tests] for Rustup. We use [trycmd] to test the CLI of Rustup. In this post I will show you how to use `trycmd` to test your CLI.

[Rustup 1.26.0]: https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/04/25/Rustup-1.26.0.html
[clap]: https://github.com/clap-rs/clap
[UI tests]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/blob/master/tests/suite/cli_ui.rs
[trycmd]: https://github.com/assert-rs/trycmd

## Why trycmd?

Because it is very easy to use and well developed. It is also very easy to integrate with CI. We can use `cargo test` to run the test cases. Most importantly, `trcmd` is recommended by the `clap` team. You can find its document in the [clap upgrade guide].

## What is trycmd?

From the [README] of `trycmd`: "`trycmd` is a test harness that will enumerate test case files and run them to verify the results, taking inspiration from [trybuild] and [cram]."

Here is an example:

```rust
// tests/cli_tests.rs
#[test]
fn cli_tests() {
    trycmd::TestCases::new()
        .case("tests/cmd/*.toml")
        .case("README.md");
}
```

We can use `trycmd::TestCases::new()` to create a new test case. Then we can use `.case()` to add test cases. The argument of `.case()` is a glob pattern. It will enumerate all the files that match the pattern and run them as test cases.

In this example, we used `tests/cmd/*.toml` to match all the files in `tests/cmd` that end with `.toml`. We also use `README.md` as a test case. The `README.md` file is a markdown file, but trycmd will treat it as a test case. It will run the command in the code block and verify the output, which is a very useful feature when you want to test the examples in your README.

We can treat this test case as a normal test case and run it with `cargo test`.

## How to write a test case?

We have two types of test cases available: TOML files and Markdown files. The TOML file provides more flexibility compared to the Markdown file. It allows us to test command line arguments, command output, and even the exit code of the command. On the other hand, the Markdown file is a simpler option that allows us to focus on testing the output of the command.

In clap documentation, you can find a [simple example] of trycmd. But it only tests a Markdown file. In this post, I will show you how to write a TOML file and a Markdown file test. You can find more examples from some real projects, like [typos tests], [clap tests] and [rustup tests].

[simple example]: https://github.com/assert-rs/trycmd/tree/main/examples/demo_trycmd
[typos tests]: https://github.com/crate-ci/typos/blob/master/crates/typos-cli/tests/cli_tests.rs
[clap tests]: https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/tree/master/tests/ui
[rustup tests]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/blob/master/tests/suite/cli_ui.rs

### TOML file

Here is an example of a TOML file:

```toml
# tests/cmd/help.toml
bin.name = "YOUR_BIN_NAME"
args = ["--help"]
status.code = 0
stdout = """
HELP MESSAGE
"""
stderr = ""
```

We can use `bin.name` for the binary name, `args` for command arguments, `status.code` for the exit code, and `stdout` and `stderr` for command output.

If your CLI requires reading input files, you can organize them in a separate directory with the same name but with a `.in` suffix. For instance, if your CLI needs to read a file called `input.txt` and your test case is located at `tests/cmd/input.toml`, you can place the `input.txt` file in the directory `tests/cmd/input.in/input.txt`. This naming convention helps to distinguish input files from other files and maintain a structured organization for your test cases.

```toml
# tests/cmd/input.toml
bin.name = "YOUR_BIN_NAME"
status.code = 0
stdout = ""
stderr = ""
```

```console
tree tests/cmd
.
├── input.toml
└── input.in
    └── input.txt
```

If your CLI involves writing output files, you can utilize a directory with the same name as the test file but with a `.out` suffix to store the generated output files. For instance, if your CLI reads the `input.txt` file and writes the `output.txt` file, you can place the `output.txt` file in the directory `tests/cmd/input.out/output.txt`.

```console
tree tests/cmd
.
├── input.toml
├── input.in
│   └── input.txt
└── input.out
    ├── input.txt
    └── output.txt
```

`trycmd` will compare the output file with the expected output file. If they are different, the test will fail.

### Markdown file

In markdown files, we can utilize either the `console` or `trycmd` code block to represent test cases. Here's an example:

~~~md
```console
$ command ...
```
Or
```trycmd
$ command ...
```
~~~

Sometimes, your test might include output that is generated at runtime. When that's the case, you can use variables to replace those values.

~~~md
```console
$ simple "blah blah runtime-value blah"
Hello blah blah [REPLACEMENT] blah!
```
~~~

In this example, we used `[REPLACEMENT]` to indicate the runtime value. We can use `trycmd::TestCases::new().case("README.md").insert_var("REPLACEMENT", "runtime-value")` to replace the runtime value.

```console
$ simple "blah blah runtime-value blah"
Hello blah blah runtime-value blah!
```

The `console` code block will substitute [REPLACEMENT] with the value of the `REPLACEMENT` variable. The test will pass if the output is `Hello blah blah runtime-value blah!`. If the output differs from this expected value, the test will fail.

## One Real Example

### Create a CLI

1. [Use `cargo new` to create a new CLI.](https://github.com/hi-rustin/trycmd-example/commit/ead3a18e2502f23ee856fe1d3fca8109b6e867cb)

    ```sh
    cargo new --bin trycmd-example
    ```

2. [Add clap as a dependency with `derive` feature.](https://github.com/hi-rustin/trycmd-example/commit/a7b10c45ad04b2c2667d5c7c2b48e659018eb9a9)

    ```sh
    cargo add clap --features derive
    ```

    Check the `Cargo.toml` file. You should see the `clap` dependency.

    ```toml
    # Cargo.toml
    [package]
    name = "trycmd-example"
    version = "0.1.0"
    edition = "2021"

    # See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

    [dependencies]
    clap = { version = "4.3.10", features = ["derive"] }
    ```

3. [Add a simple CLI.](https://github.com/hi-rustin/trycmd-example/commit/a9a227147b7918d7caa48c86095494f39a716d5d)

    ```rust
    // src/main.rs
    use clap::Parser;

    /// Simple program to greet a person
    #[derive(Parser, Debug)]
    #[command(author, version, about, long_about = None)]
    struct Args {
        /// Name of the person to greet
        #[arg(short, long)]
        name: String,

        /// Number of times to greet
        #[arg(short, long, default_value_t = 1)]
        count: u8,
    }

    fn main() {
        let args = Args::parse();

        for _ in 0..args.count {
            println!("Hello {}!", args.name)
        }
    }
    ```

4. Build the CLI to make sure it works.

    ```sh
    cargo build
    ./target/debug/trycmd-example --help
    ```

    Get the output:

    ```console
    Simple program to greet a person

    Usage: trycmd-example [OPTIONS] --name <NAME>

    Options:
    -n, --name <NAME>    Name of the person to greet
    -c, --count <COUNT>  Number of times to greet [default: 1]
    -h, --help           Print help
    -V, --version        Print version
    ```

    Now we have a simple CLI. Let's add some test cases.

### Add a TOML test case

1. Create a `tests/cmd` directory.

    ```sh
    mkdir -p tests/cmd
    ```

    ```console
    tree . --gitignore
    .
    ├── Cargo.lock
    ├── Cargo.toml
    ├── src
    │   └── main.rs
    └── tests
        └── cmd
    ```

2. [Create a `tests/cmd/help.toml` file.](https://github.com/hi-rustin/trycmd-example/commit/3af3e458b2f6e2316843a43aae6e28aff9c671bf)

    ```sh
    touch tests/cmd/help.toml
    ```

    ```toml
    # tests/cmd/help.toml
    bin.name = "trycmd-example"
    args = ["--help"]
    status.code = 0
    stdout = ""
    stderr = ""
    ```

3. [Add `trycmd` as a dev dependency.](https://github.com/hi-rustin/trycmd-example/commit/9c17c3d3ce756a00969cd0f72d92372dda930593)

    ```sh
    cargo add trycmd --dev
    ```

    Check the `Cargo.toml` file. You should see the `trycmd` dependency.

    ```toml
    # Cargo.toml
    [package]
    name = "trycmd-example"
    version = "0.1.0"
    edition = "2021"

    # See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

    [dependencies]
    clap = { version = "4.3.10", features = ["derive"] }

    [dev-dependencies] # <-- Add this section
    trycmd = "0.14.16" # <-- Add this line
    ```

4. [Add a Rust test case.](https://github.com/hi-rustin/trycmd-example/commit/570561be3c96d6ce2e673836719a31e2bd51346d)

    ```sh
    touch tests/cmd.rs
    ```

    ```rust
    // tests/cmd.rs
    #[test]
    fn test_cmd() {
        let t = trycmd::TestCases::new();
        let trycmd_example_binary = trycmd::cargo::cargo_bin("trycmd-example");
        t.register_bin("trycmd-example", &trycmd_example_binary);
        t.case("tests/cmd/*.toml");
    }
    ```

    For this test case, we start by creating a new test case using `trycmd::TestCases::new()`. Next, we obtain the path of the trycmd-example binary by utilizing `trycmd::cargo::cargo_bin("trycmd-example")`. Lastly, we run all the test cases in the `tests/cmd` directory by invoking `t.case("tests/cmd/*.toml")`.

5. Run the test case.

    ```sh
    cargo test
    ```

    The test case will fail because we don't have right output in the `tests/cmd/help.toml` file.

    ```console
    running 1 test
    Testing tests/cmd/help.toml ... failed
    Exit: success

    ---- expected: stdout
    ++++ actual:   stdout
            1 + Simple program to greet a person
            2 +
            3 + Usage: trycmd-example [OPTIONS] --name <NAME>
            4 +
            5 + Options:
            6 +   -n, --name <NAME>    Name of the person to greet
            7 +   -c, --count <COUNT>  Number of times to greet [default: 1]
            8 +   -h, --help           Print help
            9 +   -V, --version        Print version
    stderr:

    Update snapshots with `TRYCMD=overwrite`
    Debug output with `TRYCMD=dump`
    test test_cmd ... FAILED
    ```

### [Overwrite the output](https://github.com/hi-rustin/trycmd-example/commit/6c8123d456c4c6333e1986db2fc7bf80d62f5cc9)

AS you can see from the output, we can use `TRYCMD=overwrite` to overwrite the output in the `tests/cmd/help.toml` file.

```sh
TRYCMD=overwrite cargo test
```

> Note: If you are using Windows, your test output will be different from the output above. This is because on Windows the executable file extension is `.exe`. So the output would be `trycmd-example.exe` instead of `trycmd-example`. So you can set it to`trycmd-example[EXE]` in `tests/cmd/help.toml` to make it work on all platforms.

### Add a Markdown test case

Usually, we use this feature to test the `README.md` or other example files.

1. [Create a README.md file.](https://github.com/hi-rustin/trycmd-example/commit/c8375173cbad8987f33f6c12ad9f0bb6fb4a85a8)

    ```sh
    touch README.md
    ```

    ~~~markdown
    # trycmd-example

    ```console
    $ trycmd-example --help
    ```
    ~~~

2. [Add README.md as a test case.](https://github.com/hi-rustin/trycmd-example/commit/c7489852927e52efa6e4b7a805628d13e7bf1c55)

    ```rust
    // tests/cmd.rs
    #[test]
    fn test_cmd() {
        let t = trycmd::TestCases::new();
        let trycmd_example_binary = trycmd::cargo::cargo_bin("trycmd-example");
        t.register_bin("trycmd-example", &trycmd_example_binary);
        t.case("tests/cmd/*.toml");
        t.case("README.md"); // <-- Add this line
    }
    ```

3. Run the test case.

    ```sh
    cargo test
    ```

    The test case will fail because we don't have right output in the `README.md` file.

    ```console
    running 1 test
    Testing tests/cmd/help.toml ... ok
    Testing README.md:4 ... failed
    Exit: success

    ---- expected: stdout
    ++++ actual:   stdout
            1 + Simple program to greet a person
            2 +
            3 + Usage: trycmd-example [OPTIONS] --name <NAME>
            4 +
            5 + Options:
            6 +   -n, --name <NAME>    Name of the person to greet
            7 +   -c, --count <COUNT>  Number of times to greet [default: 1]
            8 +   -h, --help           Print help
            9 +   -V, --version        Print version
    stderr:

    Update snapshots with `TRYCMD=overwrite`
    Debug output with `TRYCMD=dump`
    test test_cmd ... FAILED
    ```

4. [Overwrite the output.](https://github.com/hi-rustin/trycmd-example/commit/80c3c9bad811bd11933935421c8f80b65ba74c17)

    ```sh
    TRYCMD=overwrite cargo test
    ```

    `trycmd` will overwrite the output in the `README.md` file.

### Use directory to store input and output files

To organize input and output files effectively, we can utilize a dedicated directory specifically designed for storing these files.

Right now, we print the output to the console. If we want to print the output to a file, we also can test it with `trycmd`.

1. [Change the `main.rs` file.](https://github.com/hi-rustin/trycmd-example/commit/900cddd1ebedc3932f2bf6d7c3e98b60182b5976)

    ```rust
    // src/main.rs
    use std::io::Write; // <-- Add this line

    use clap::Parser;

    /// Simple program to greet a person
    #[derive(Parser, Debug)]
    #[command(author, version, about, long_about = None)]
    struct Args {
        /// Name of the person to greet
        #[arg(short, long)]
        name: String,

        /// Number of times to greet
        #[arg(short, long, default_value_t = 1)]
        count: u8,
    }

    fn main() {
        let args = Args::parse();

        // Print the greeting to a file. <-- Add this line
        let mut file = std::fs::File::create("greeting.txt").unwrap(); // <-- Add this line
        for _ in 0..args.count { // <-- Add this line
            writeln!(file, "Hello, {}!", args.name).unwrap(); // <-- Add this line
        } // <-- Add this line
    }
    ```

2. [Add a new TOML test case.](https://github.com/hi-rustin/trycmd-example/commit/d52071fe1d93c00c84a42a5fae68776d726c30a7)

    ```sh
    touch tests/cmd/greeting.toml
    ```

    ```toml
    # tests/cmd/greeting.toml
    bin.name = "trycmd-example"
    args = ["--name", "foo"]
    status.code = 0
    stdout = ""
    stderr = ""
    ```

3. [Add an output directory and an output file.](https://github.com/hi-rustin/trycmd-example/commit/92ca6c26f1f10a48a0df5ca5dbb6c9b477540bec)

    ```sh
    mkdir tests/cmd/greeting.out
    touch tests/cmd/greeting.out/greeting.txt
    ```

4. Run the test case.

    ```sh
    cargo test
    ```

    The test case will fail because we don't have right output in the `tests/cmd/greeting.out/greeting.txt` file.

    ```console
    running 1 test
    Testing README.md:4 ... ok
    Testing tests/cmd/help.toml ... ok
    Testing tests/cmd/greeting.toml ... ok
    Testing tests/cmd/greeting.toml:teardown ... failed
    Failed: Files left in unexpected state

    tests/cmd/greeting.out: is good

    ---- expected: tests/cmd/greeting.out/greeting.txt
    ++++ actual:   /private/var/folders/76/zkdsk83x0dl3qydmhxf9dj3h0000gn/T/.tmpW1Aqys/greeting.txt
            1 + Hello, foo!
    Update snapshots with `TRYCMD=overwrite`
    Debug output with `TRYCMD=dump`
    test test_cmd ... FAILED
    ```

5. [Overwrite the output.](https://github.com/hi-rustin/trycmd-example/commit/ecc694e73d0946bda0d5e65925dc6912ab3dee69)

    ```sh
    TRYCMD=overwrite cargo test
    ```

    `trycmd` will overwrite the output in the `tests/cmd/greeting.out/greeting.txt` file.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to use `trycmd` to test a CLI program. We also learned how to use `TRYCMD=overwrite` to overwrite the output in the test case files. This feature is very useful when we want to update the output in the test case files. Hope you enjoy this tutorial and use `trycmd` to test your CLI programs.
